## Write code that requires minimal human attention 

- Fact: every line of code requires human review, so write readable code not just working code.

- Build reusable, trustworthy components that has deep logic but thin interface, so that human only need to review the complexity once (reuse the attention).

- Follow Rust best practices to save human attention from reviewing for common mistakes.

- Before implementing a new feature, identify similar existing features, and check if it's worth to refactor existing code so it's reusable.

## Engineering

- Prefer explicit props and function arguments so ownership and data flow remain visible. Use context only when a dependency must cross at least two component layers and the intermediate parent does not use it. Keep state owned by the component that creates it.


- use descriptive, intention-revealing names for variables and functions, don't use generic names like `Built`, `Common`, `View`.

- do not use free form functions, functions should have a clear owner, e.g., struct, enum; unless it is fully justified stateless function.
  Example 1: `fn build_chart(model: &DataModel) -> Built`, instead use a member method like: `fn build_chart(&self) -> Built`. Even better, use a `From` trait to build the chart from the data model.
  Example 2: `fn toggle_expand(code: crate::views::codemap::CodeState, key: (u32, u32))` instead use a member method like: `fn toggle_expand(&self, key: (u32, u32))`.

- try to use minimal visibility for functions and variables, e.g., a pub function under a private mod is essentially private, but it is confusing, prefer to make it private. 

- try to avoid public fields, prefer to use getters and setters, unless the field is truly public.

- organize the code by features, not by technical buckets, e.g., don't have `api.rs`, `views.rs`, `data.rs`, etc. Instead, do `settings.rs`, `data_panel.rs`, `code_map.rs`, etc.

- No static variables.
